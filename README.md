# Project Description
"Star Trivia!" is my First attempt at a MERN stack app. This was designed as a fun, easy to use app and friendly to all ages.

"Star Trivia!" uses data stored in MONGODB to add in questions of your choosing and also have pre-selected questions. It has a page you can study on and sharpen your skills, powered by SWAPI, an open source Star Wars API. Users can browse the vast API for informations on Films, Characters, Species, and more! 


# Installation Instructions
* Clone this repo down to your local machine!
* Make an ENV File and add a mongoDB connection
* Run the following in the terminal...
```
npm i
```
```
npm i react-router-dom axios antd
```

# User Stories

* As a Customer, I want to play a trivia game, so that I can have a fun activity to play.

* As an Potential Employer, I want to see what this MERN stack file has functionality wise, so that I can decide if he has the skills the company is looking for.

* As a Colleague, I want to see the improvement of my colleague, that way I can view his progress at the end of the course.

# Wireframes


# Major Hurdles

* Heroku. I am still getting used to Heroku and how it works. It is very tedious and I dont quite understand it all, but I sure I will one day!
* React. React was a little challenging for me. It is very nice to use vite and it tells you where issues lie, but React is still new to me and I will have to keep working with it to understand.
* Questions CRUD. I currently have a bug where I cant get the questions to appear with the seeded questions and it might be because of ANT design or it might be because I am doing something wrong. Not 100% but still need to diagnose that problem.
* SWAPI API. With the starships and vehicles part not working correctly, I am not sure I will be able to implement those into my project, but I want more time to look into it.


# Next Steps

I plan on implementing a few new steps...
* Unfortunately, while SWAPI was an awesome API to use, it does not include pictures NOR is it being worked on anymore. I want to integrate the Pipedream Photos API side by side with SWAPI that way all information points can have photos to go along with the data.
* I want to Paginate the More information area.
* Some more design features, One specifically is adding the gif at the top of the page to be the first thing you see when you launch the site!
* Add more questions.
* Adding the classic Star Wars crawl text! This is a must and I will be working towards getting it to work.
